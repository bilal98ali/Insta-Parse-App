# Project 3 - *InstaParse*

**InstaParse** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication.
- [ ] User can log in and log out of his or her account.
- [ ] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts.
- [ ] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram".

## Notes

- I was not able to complete the required functionality due to failure of implementing parse login and navigationâ€”which, also prevented me from defining data object and query, and implementing image capture and post creation. 

## Open-source Libraries Used:

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Android
